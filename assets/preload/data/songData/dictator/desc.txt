We know who Mario is....or do we? In Secret Histories we show the true face of characters who are seen as "heroes" but in reality hide secrets that you would never imagine. Mario doesn't like competition, and wanting to continue with his monopoly, he won't mind killing people to achieve his goal.                                                       Based on Mashed's "Secret Histories" series.
