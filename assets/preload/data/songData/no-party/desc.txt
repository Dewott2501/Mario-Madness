DJ Hallyboo is upset! As              the secret host of                   Mario Party DS, he takes               it personally when he                  finds out his players              haven't even paid for                 the game.                     Notoriously quick to                exact his revenge, your              best option is probably       apologizing. But be hasty,         because he won't give you             all day!                             Good luck, Boyfriend!
